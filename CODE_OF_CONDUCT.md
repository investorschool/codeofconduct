## Investor School: Community and Conduct

## Our Community

Investor School is a community of accredited angel and startup investors--alumni of the invitation-only [Y Combinator (YC) Startup Investor School](https://investor.startupschool.org/) workshop held in March 2018. Following that workshop, participants self-organized to share information, cultivate professional relationships, and source investment deals. The group thus indirectly was launched by YC but is now self-governed and is not affiliated. Many Investor School members maintain close ties with YC as former YC founders and active investors. Further, despite the "school" name, the vast majority of, if not all, Investor School members are accomplished technology startup entrepreneurs or experienced software executives.
  
For its members and partners, Investor School provides value as infrastructure to 1) communicate and connect to excellent, well-connected active angel investors, and 2) early access to some of the world's most-promising emerging technology companies. The group maintains a private Slack workgroup and organizes monthly events in the Bay Area. Recent Investor School meetings featured prominent speakers such as Sri Chandrasekar (Partner, Point72), Tim Draper (Founder, DFJ), Ben Narasin (Venture Partner, NEA), and Priya Rajan (Director of Early Stage, SVB). The meetups routinely also host 5-10 highly curated pitches from very early companies. 
  
The group is administered by [Brad Flora](https://angel.co/brad-flora) (YC S11), [Alan Glennon](https://angel.co/glennon) (Angel), [Tim Suzman](https://angel.co/tim-s) (YC S11), and [Judy Yang](https://angel.co/judy-yang) (Angel). [Christopher Fong](https://angel.co/christopher-fong) (Xoogler), [Anand Krishna](https://angel.co/anand108) (YC S17), and [Aaron White](http://www.vistawealth.com/our-team/aaron-white) (Vista Wealth) provide at-large support. Inquiries about Slack channel creation and membership invitations should be directed to an administrator. The group does not make collective investments; is volunteer led; and no dues or fees are collected. The community is committed to fostering a welcoming, harassment-free environment for its members.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Community discussions center on startups, founders, deals, and investors. It is the responsibility of all participants to honor these entrepreneurial endeavors by being prudent and circumspect about the sharing of information both within and external to the group. Material denoted by an author as confidential should be considered private to the Investor School community and may only be shared among members.  

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The group administrators and organizing teams are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Group administrators have the responsibility and right to remove, edit, or reject comments, and other contributions that are not aligned to community standards, or to ban temporarily or permanently a member for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all individuals participating in Investor School online discussions and in-person events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the organizing team at glennon+investor_conduct@gmail.com (Alan Glennon). The organizing team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Organizing team members who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
