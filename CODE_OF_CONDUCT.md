## Investor School: Community and Conduct

## Our Community

:pencil2: DRAFT :pencil2: DRAFT :pencil2: DRAFT :pencil2:

Investor School is a community of angel and startup investors--alumni of the [YC Startup Investor School](https://investor.startupschool.org/) workshop held in March 2018. We maintain a Slack Group and host occasional events in the Bay Area. The group was launched by YCombinator but is now self-governed and no longer YC affiliated.

The Slack Group is maintained by [Brad Flora](https://angel.co/brad-flora) (YC S11), [Tim Suzman](https://angel.co/tim-s) (YC S11), and [Judy Yang](https://angel.co/judy-yang). Inquiries about channel creation and membership invitations can be directed to any of these administrators. Events are organized and led by [Christopher Fong](https://angel.co/christopher-fong), [Anand Krishna](https://angel.co/anand108) (YC S17), and [Aaron White](http://www.vistawealth.com/our-team/aaron-white). [Alan Glennon](https://angel.co/glennon) provides at-large administrative support.  

Community discussions center on startups, founders, deals, and investors. It is the responsibility of all participants to honor these entrepreneurial endeavors by being prudent and circumspect about the sharing of information both within and external to the group. Material denoted by an author as confidential should be considered private to the Investor School community and may only be shared among members.

## Our Responsibilities

The group administrators and organizing teams are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
